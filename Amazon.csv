"Presents a challenging, growth opportunity covering all aspects of online marketing and e-Commerce."
large and challenging
"New warehouse opened in 2012, great GM who is very friendly and resourceful. Most are very grateful to be employed."
Hard work with decent pay and some benefits make it not the worst place to work for.

"Fulfillment Associate at Kent, WA warehouse review."
Enjoy working with a lot of people
"Company has structure, encourages management to grow and be promoted, hires outside of the company, good insurance."
"Good people, good workers, culture of poor engineering practice."
Lots of great promises but....
Amazon is disillusioned and lost in the real world of sales and retail
Work at home seasonal customer service is convienient but also very demanding.
Not for everyone

"Amazon is a decent employer, who takes decent care of their employees."
For the most part I enjoyed working at Amazon.
Inbound/receiver
It's among the best warehouse jobs in the area (but it's still a warehouse job).
Not for me
"It's not for everyone, but for those who enjoyed it received a lot in return for the hard work."
Great experience but not a long-term gig.
it would be considered to be a demanding jobs constantly on your feet.

Worked to capacity
Great Place... ...for doers.
Demanding and rewarding Fortune 50 company to work for. Very fast paced with a high level of individual responsibility.

review
Most challenging job so far - in a good way
Inventory Analyst position where I can effectively utilize my skills and expertise.
"Discouraging, to say the least."
"In the beginning I felt Honored, at the end Disappointed"
At Amazon you are given a lot of responsibility but no training.
"Amazon is a very fast paced and challenging environment, but it is a good place grow."
"I am currently in the RSR dept., which separates and inventories special orders that need to go out immediately."
A good place to grow but only for short term
"Smart people, experience depends on manager and team"
"If your looking for a place with tons of Benefits, Amazon is your place."
This company is a so so!!
Not as great as Amazon makes it sound.
"Hard work, with a lot of opportunity and ownership"
Working at amazon was great you get payed 11.50 an hour and the break room is big.
Able to earn a good paycheck with full-time hours and only 4 days a week.
Outside Supervisor experience doesn't count.
Warehouse work
Amazon.com fulfillment center
A fascinating workplace on many different levels but physically demanding.
The company and how I felt
"Adversarial, distrustful, all-encompassing"

"Dog eat dog, fast paced, smart people"
Tough place. Swim or sink; you are on your own.
